 Please note this build will be extremely limited - essentially a "digital business card" approach: 

**$650 is Bare-Bones Version:**
- **5 pages maximum**: Home, About, Services, Contact, Gallery (static)
- **WordPress with free theme** (minimal customization)
- **Basic contact form** 
- **Simple photo grid** (10-15 photos max, no interactive gallery)
- **Mobile responsive** (essential)
- **Basic SEO setup**
- **Content**: Text only from archive (no complex migration)

**What you're NOT getting:**
- ❌ Any e-commerce/shopping
- ❌ Dynamic features
- ❌ Custom design
- ❌ Archive content migration
- ❌ Professional photos/graphics
- ❌ Advanced SEO
- ❌ Integrations
- ❌ User accounts
- ❌ Professional copywriting

**Realistic expectations at $650:**
- 10-15 hours of basic development work
- Template-based design (not custom)
- You provide all content/photos
- Basic hosting setup
- Essential functionality only

**This works if:**
- You just need online presence ASAP
- You plan to upgrade within 6-12 months
- You can provide content/photos ready-to-use
- You're okay with very basic aesthetics
- Main goal is Google presence + contact info

**Better approach might be:**
- Squarespace/Wix for $200-400 (DIY)
- Save the $650 toward a $2000 Phase 1 that's actually functional

Is the $650 version about establishing minimal online presence while you plan something bigger?
